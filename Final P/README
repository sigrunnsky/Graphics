Final Project Checkpoint: Sigrunn Sky

Time Spent: Alot of Hours

* Used my HW 5 as a starting point
* referenced Exammple 15 from class on how to apply textures. 
* http://www.swiftless.com/opengltuts.html for help with fps and fog 
* Used https://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/showthread.php/167115-Creating-cylinder for help on math for cylinders. 
* Help from various in-class examples, such as Ex. 25 with the SkyCube

Yet to be done:

* Christmas lights on the cabin (shining)
* Light shining out of the windows
* Double Check surface Normals (There are very many surfaces!!!)
* The ground texture needs work. I am not sure why, but it does not look nice.

Stretch Goals:

* Better Trees and more objects. Maybe a fence around the cabin.
* Snow Falling from the Sky. (much harder than I thought it would be.)
* Draw a skycube with Mountains. I have not been able to find a nice one online that is in the right format.
* Chimney.. with smoke!
