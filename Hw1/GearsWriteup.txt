1) The frame rate reported by the program when the window is different sizes,
specifically 1x1, 300x300 and full screen. Explain your results.

1x1 
The frame rate ranged between 2800 FPS and 3050 FPS

300x300
The frame rate ranged between 2895 FPS and 3000 FPS
The results for 300x300 were very similiar to 1x1

FullScreen
The frame rate ranged between 600 FPS and 700 FPS
Fullscreen has the slowest frame rate by far. I set the screen size to the number of pixels on my laptop so the fact that this is not a square like the other dimensions could have an adverse effect. 

2) On some systems the frame rate is a small round number like 60 or 72 or 85
frames per second, and sometimes it is a large number, thousands or tens of
thousands of frames per second. Explain why this occurs.

This happens because the GPU ( Graphics Processing Unit) can be capped at 60 FPS. If it is not capped, then it can run much much faster.

3) Time required to complete the assignment.
